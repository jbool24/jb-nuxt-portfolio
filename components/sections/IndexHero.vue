            | I graduated from NYU with a degree in music and used to be a performer,
            | worked in chemical manufacturing for half a decade, spend a little time in the continuing education space,
            | and each opportunity has taught me many things.
            | I spend a lot of time reading technical documentation
            | and researching open-source software that I like to follow, especially home-automation.
            | I am always looking for cool things to work on so if you want to
            | talk tech, need some help or information about a project, or you
            | have a great idea I can make a reality for you, <span class="font-bold">reach out!</span>
            | Iâ€™m here and would love to connect.
